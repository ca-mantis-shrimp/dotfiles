This is for configuring the various LLM shells.

Now, a few notes on architecture:

- Most LLMs have a scoped system meaning you can have different levels of files that operate at different scopes:
-- User level - for user specific configuration
-- Repo level - for repository specific configuration
-- Global level - for system wide configuration
-- Each level has its own Agents.md file that instructs the LLM how to behave at that level
- Most LLMs have their own name for this file but it serves the same purpose
-- Therefore, these files can either be exported directly into the proper place, or put into a neutral place and the other files can be symlinked
- unlike most configuration files in the literate config, these files are NOT intended to be tangled, but instead are intended to be exported using either `Neorg export to-file` or `pandoc` for a cli experience directly to markdown
-- I needed to make this readme as these help to underscore this point without messing up the files themselves
* Index

  So we have the following files:
  - {:$/LLM-cli/User-Scope-Agents:}[User-Scope-Agents] - Instructions for all projects for the User of the computer
  -- `Neorg export to-file ~/.config/claude/CLAUDE.md` for example
  - {:$/LLM-cli/Repo-Scope-Agents:}[Repo-Scope-Agents] - Instructions
  -- `Neorg export to-file ~/.local/share/chezmoi/.claude/CLAUDE.md` for example

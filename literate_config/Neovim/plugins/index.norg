Plugins are what really makes Neovim special, and here we can explore the magic (and frustration) of using plugins created for Neovim by the community

I think to start, I am just going to start with the smaller stuff and then work through it one at a time. Especially large plugins will likely get their own file so I can decouple them from what I have to do with the others which can be generated all at once
* {:neorg:}[Neorg configuration]
* {:Telescope:}[Telescope Config]
* {:smart_splits:}[Smart Splits Config]
* Opening the Plugin File
  First, we just need to remember that lazy expects a table of tables so we start by opening the return table from which all other table with be contained.
  #tangle
  @code lua
  return {
  @end
* Portal Configuration
  Portal is an interesting little plugin that enables us to visualize the jumplist before you just jump there.
  #tangle
  @code lua
  {
    "cbochs/portal.nvim",
    dependencies = { "cbochs/grapple.nvim" },
    keys = {
      { "<leader>o", "<cmd>Portal jumplist backward<cr>" },
      { "<leader>i", "<cmd>Portal jumplist forward<cr>" },
    },
  },
  @end
  - {https://github.com/cbochs/grapple.nvim/tree/ab274a3bfb674442d57fca05df866b71895853bc}[grapple.nvim] serves as the core library that allows for this file list and enable the preview capabilities
  - Otherwise, the plugin is only loaded when you use either of the keybinds above
  -- we chose `<leader>`o and i because it mirrors the normal jumplist hotkeys to express that they are paralell but different features
* Noice
  {https://github.com/folke/noice.nvim}[noice.nvim] is a super interesting, experimental plugin that was made by our resident hero folke.

  This plugin does many things, but chief among them is:
  - Introduction of great notifications via noice.nvim
  - Replacing command lines with a new popup format
  - and a bunch of other little things that make neovim really feel like an editor from the twenty first century

  #tangle
  @code lua
  {
    "folke/noice.nvim",
    cond = not vim.g.started_by_firenvim,
  },
  @end
* LSP Lines
  By Default, LSP diagnostics are displayed as virtual text at the end of the line
  Virtual Text is the text that is made outside of the buffer and can move to stick to a specific line rather than being present in the buffer
  - However, this makes it dificult to read all bust the most succinct warnings/errors
  - doubly-so for the case where we have multiple diagnostics/errors to review

  {https://github.com/ErichDonGubler/lsp_lines.nvim/tree/3b57922d2d79762e6baedaf9d66d8ba71f822816}[lsp_lines.nvim] attempts to fix this issue by replacing the default virtual text solution with one where instead each diagnostic gets its own line (hence the name) so multiple/long diagnostic messages can be shown without issue
  #tangle
  @code lua
  {
    "ErichDonGubler/lsp_lines.nvim",
    dependencies = { "neovim/nvim-lspconfig" },
    config = function()
      vim.diagnostic.config({
        virtual_text = false,
      })
      require("lsp_lines").setup()
    end,
    ft = { "lua", "python", "rust" },
  },
  @end
  - First, we need to ensure this is loaded after lspconfig since this relies on the configuration for this.
  - we have to use the functional way of setting up the plugin because we need to make a small change first
  -- The thing we need to do is disable the default virtual_text solution for diagnostics in Neovim
  --- if we dont, this will result in duplicate diagnostic messages when we are editing code
  --- afterwards, we can setup the plugin like normal
  - Finally, we need to restrict the filetypes that we enable lsp_lines on because otherwise we get annoying duplication in things like the lazy floating window
* Git Diff
  The standard diff view for Neovim is fine, but it leaves a few things to be desired.
  - It doesn't feel like a really integrated solution with the ability to show the context
  - More importantly, it can't show multiple files easily making the process of reviewing diffs for multiple files (as if often the case when we do `chezmoi apply`), then it can make the process feel cumbersome
  #tangle
  @code lua
  {
    { "sindrets/diffview.nvim", dependencies = "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim" },
  },
  @end
* Chezmoi Support
  Chezmoi has a bunch of strange files so this (rather old) plugin justt ries to smooth over the rough edges by properly highlighting these files and whatnot.
  #tangle
  @code lua
  {
    "alker0/chezmoi.vim",
  },
  @end
* ChatGPT
  ChatGPT can be configured with a specific plugin someone made to engage with the 3.5 model
  #tangle
  @code lua
  {
    "jackMort/ChatGPT.nvim",
    config = function() 
      require('chatgpt').setup()
    end,
    event = "VeryLazy",
    dependencies = {
      "MunifTanjim/nui.nvim",
      "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
      "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim",
    },
  },
  @end
  - we use nui and plenary to make it look good
  - while telescope is used as the menu that we primarily integrate with
* Running Rest Commands
  I'm going to be doing more rest development work so I would like to be able to run rest calls from within the editor so i don't need to rely on tools like postman or stuff like that.
  For this we are going to be using [rest.nvim] which is a plugin that allows you to run rest commands from within Neovim.
  Nothing super interesting here, we pull in the plugin and for now just use the standard config.
  #tangle
  @code lua
  {
    "rest-nvim/rest.nvim",
    dependencies = {"nvim-lua/plenary.nvim"},
    config = true
  },
  @end
* {https://github.com/wfxr/minimap.vim/tree/726746ed02eab2eef137a7ecceda7214fbeeec41}[Code Minimap]
  In an attempt to get something close to what VSCode has, I am trying
  #tangle
  @code lua
  {
    "wfxr/minimap.vim",
    keys = { { "leader>um", "<cmd>MinimapToggle<cr>", desc = "Toggle Minimap" } },
    build = "cargo install --locked code-minimap",
    lazy = false,
  },
  @end
* [symbols-outline.nvim]
  Symbol outline is a plugin that allows you to see all of the symbols in a file and jump to them.

  We are just doing standard setup, but we have chosen to do this now because of the release of edgy which allows these outlines to be used in a left pane window

  #tangle
  @code lua
  {
    -- add symbols-outline
    {
      "simrat39/symbols-outline.nvim",
      cmd = "SymbolsOutline",
      keys = { { "<leader>cs", "<cmd>SymbolsOutline<cr>", desc = "Symbols Outline" } },
      opts = {},
      config = true
    },
  },
  @end
* Adding Support for PlantUML
  We are going to use the {https://github.com/aklt/plantuml-syntax}[PlantUML Syntax File] to actually work with PlantUML files:
  #tangle
  @code lua
  {
    "weirongxu/plantuml-previewer.vim",
    dependencies = {"aklt/plantuml-syntax", "tyru/open-browser.vim"},
  },
  @end
  This is going to just enable syntax highlighting for the various plantuml files while also giving us the ability to create graphviz files from these files in the future
* Color Schemes
  We are going to try and put all of the color schemes into a single file to reduce the amount of breakage we get from adding new things

  #tangle
  @code lua
  {"projekt0n/github-nvim-theme"},
  @end
  - we have the GitHub theme because I am hoping to finally get a good light theme since this apartment makes it much harder to leverage the dark themes when compared to the setups I have had before
* Filetype Plugins
  Neo(Vim) includes support for several languages out-of-the-box, but ofcourse, it can't support everything, and for other languages, teams and individuals are able to create much more refined experiences when compared to basic syntax highlighting. This file is where we will store many of the small plugins which are primarily intended to support specific filetypes.

  #tangle
  @code lua
  {
    'cameron-wags/rainbow_csv.nvim',
    config = true,
    ft = {
      'csv',
      'tsv',
      'csv_semicolon',
      'csv_whitespace',
      'csv_pipe',
      'rfc_csv',
      'rfc_semicolon'
    },
    cmd = {
      'RainbowDelim',
      'RainbowDelimSimple',
      'RainbowDelimQuoted',
      'RainbowMultiDelim'
    }
  },
  @end

* Extending conform.nvim
  Lazy comes equipped with conform.nvim, but it is still up to us to ensure this is configured properly for the languages we want to use so im going to try extending it here:

  #table
  @code lua
  { "stevearc/conform.nvim",
    opts = {
      formatters_by_ft = {
        python = {"black"}
      }
    }
  },
  @end
* Enabling Neotest for Python
  while the extra for lazy is pretty plug-and-play, one piece that seems to need configuration up-front is the neotest module so we will try to extend it quickly here

  #table
  @code lua
  {
    "nvim-neotest/neotest",
    dependencies = {
      "nvim-neotest/neotest-python"
    },
    opts = {
      ["neotest-python"] = {
        runner = "pytest",
        python = os.execute('pyenv which python')
      }
    }
  },
  @end
  - first, note that we need to specify pytest as the runner.
  -- ofcourse, this means pytest is one dependency on this work
  - However the next line is the most important, since we use pyenv, we need to ensure we use whatever version we have currently set in pyenv and grab that python
  -- to do this, we run the shell command `pyenv which python` which will give the absolute path to the current python interpreter and return that as the string that neotest will use when running our tests
  -- This allows us to dynamically get the python environment as long as we have the proper setup for handling pyenv, handled earlier in the config
* Ending the plugin spec
  Finally, we end the plugin spec so everything is contained as a single table and we finish the piece we started with
  #tangle
  @code lua
  }
  @end
* Plugin List

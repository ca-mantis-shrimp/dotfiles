colorschemes are just going to be in one place so now i just want to put it all in one place

we want them pretty high priority too because they need to be powerful

we also set tokyonight as the PRIMARY colorscheme as well here

#tangle 
@code fennel
[{1 :projekt0n/github-nvim-theme}
 {1 :folke/tokyonight.nvim
  :priority 1000
  :init #(_G.vim.cmd.colorscheme :tokyonight-night)}]
@end

LLMs are the newest level of the stack and we are still trying to figure out what the format we are looking to do will be. im testing out a few plugins but i cant shake the feeling that the real answer to do is to just get really good at handling our work from within the CLI

still, the benefit here is portability and there is something to be said about the work and what it accomplishes

so for now we are just doing copilot.vim because tpope is always a solid bet and atleast we can do something with that

#tangle LLM.fnl
@code fennel
[{1 :github/copilot.vim}
 {1 :CopilotC-Nvim/CopilotChat.nvim :build "make tiktoken" :opts {}}]
@end

LLMs are the newest level of the stack and we are still trying to figure out what the format we are looking to do will be. im testing out a few plugins but i cant shake the feeling that the real answer to do is to just get really good at handling our work from within the CLI

still, the benefit here is portability and there is something to be said about the work and what it accomplishes

so for now we are just doing copilot.vim because tpope is always a solid bet and atleast we can do something with that

#tangle 
@code fennel
[{1 :github/copilot.vim}
 {1 :CopilotC-Nvim/CopilotChat.nvim :build "make tiktoken" :opts {}}
 {1 :olimorris/codecompanion.nvim
  :dependencies [{1 :ravitemer/mcphub.nvim
                  :build "npm install -g mcp-hub@latest"
                  :opts {}}]
  :opts {:extensions {:mcphub {:callback :mcphub.extensions.codecompanion
                               :opts {:make_tools true
                                      :show_server_tools_in_chat true
                                      :add_mcp_prefix_to_tool_names false
                                      :show_result_in_chat true
                                      :format_tool nil
                                      :make_vars true
                                      :make_slash_commands true}}}}
  :keys [{1 :<leader>cc
          2 :<cmd>CodeCompanionChat<CR>
          :desc "CodeCompanion Chat"}
         {1 :<leader>ci
          2 :<cmd>CodeCompanionInline<CR>
          :mode :v
          :desc "CodeCompanion Inline"}]}]

* Code Companion
  Code companion is emerging as the winner from my perspective, i really appreciate the design philsophy, it feels much more native to how a neovim plugin should work

plus i feel like there is more modularity here than say the normal avante setup which is more of an all-in-one setup

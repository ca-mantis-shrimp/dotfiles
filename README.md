# Personal Configuration
This is the site of my own personal computer configuration.

The vision is deep and has been worked on for years.

One of the biggest missions, is the mission to create a proper literate config at [the literate config folder](./literate_config/index.norg) which is a series of norg files which are supposed to not only contain the code, but the explanations for that code so that the proper context is given and decisions made can be used when talking about this work

# Non-config architecture
as for the user directory itself, we usually have a few key directories we use amongst the various operating systems that can be assumed to exist:
- `Downloads` the venerable Downloads folder where all things from the internet usually reside
- `Documents` Space for where we store stuff that doesnt fit in a repository for version control
- `Pictures` the standard pictures folder where screenshots and other visual mediums are kept
- `Products` The list of our various products we maintain, either personal or work products
- `neorg` is the main workspace for my personal notes and goals
- `knowledge` is my ever-green workspace full of knowledge on 
- `Experiments` the folder of code that is not version controlled because it is meant as throw-away code/projects. There might be loose scripts, half-baked products, and none of it will be version controlled because this is where we keep stuff

Otherwise, the file conventions of the operating system itself are respected so:
- config is in `.config` on linux and `AppData` on windows
- different files maybe be present based on if we are in a work or personal computer

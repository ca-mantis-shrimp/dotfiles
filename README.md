# Personal Configuration
This is the site of my own personal computer configuration.

The vision is deep and has been worked on for years.

One of the biggest missions, is the mission to create a proper literate config at [the literate config folder](./literate_config/index.norg) which is a series of norg files which are supposed to not only contain the code, but the explanations for that code so that the proper context is given and decisions made can be used when talking about this work
